    "># Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "## Random Forest Regressor is a supervised learning algorithm that belongs to the family of ensemble methods. It is an extension of the Random Forest Classifier and is used for regression tasks. The algorithm builds multiple decision trees and combines their results to make a final prediction. Each tree is constructed using a randomly sampled subset of the training data and a randomly sampled subset of the features. This reduces overfitting and increases the generalization ability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Forest Regressor works by constructing a large number of decision trees, each of which is trained on a random subset of the training data. The algorithm then makes a prediction by averaging the predictions of all the trees. This ensemble approach leads to a more stable and accurate model than a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The main hyperparameters of a Random Forest Regressor are the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of each tree, and the number of features to consider at each split. The performance of the algorithm depends on the choice of these hyperparameters."

    "># Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "## Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by using a technique called bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating). Bagging is a technique that involves creating multiple bootstrap samples of the original training data, and fitting a decision tree on each sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "## In Random Forest Regressor, the algorithm creates an ensemble of decision trees using bagging, and introduces an additional randomization step during the tree-building process. This randomization involves selecting a subset of features at each node, and only considering these features for the split. This process is known as feature bagging or random subspacing. By randomly selecting a subset of features, the algorithm reduces the correlation between the trees and helps to ensure that each tree in the forest is different. \n",
    "\n",
    "## This additional randomization step reduces the variance of the model, and thereby reduces the risk of overfitting. Additionally, by aggregating the predictions of multiple trees, the model can capture more complex relationships between the features and the target variable, while avoiding overfitting to noisy or irrelevant features in the data."

In other words, for each input instance, each decision tree in the ensemble predicts a numerical value, and the final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is the average of these predicted values. This approach helps to reduce the variance of the model by combining the predictions of multiple decision trees and reducing the likelihood of overfitting to the training data."
