    "# ``` Q1. What is Bayes' theorem?```\n",
    "## ```Bayes' theorem``` is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes the relationship between conditional probabilities of two events. The theorem states that the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred is equal to the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred multiplied by the probability of event A occurring and divided by the probability of event B occurring. In mathematical notation, it is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "## <center> ```P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)```\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### where P(A|B) is the conditional probability of event A given event B, P(B|A) is the conditional probability of event B given event A, P(A) is the prior probability of event A, and P(B) is the prior probability of event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayes' theorem is widely used in various fields, including machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. It is the basis for Bayesian inference, which is a statistical approach to model building and data analysis. Bayesian inference involves updating prior beliefs about a parameter or hypothesis in light of new evidence or data."

    "\n",
    "### ```Bernoulli Naive Bayes``` is similar to Multinomial Naive Bayes, but is used when the features are binary or Boolean, representing the presence or absence of a feature. This is often the case in text classification problems, where the features can be binary indicators of whether a word appears in a document or not.\n",

    "### In general, it is a good idea to try all three types of Naive Bayes classifiers on the problem at hand, and compare their performance using cross-validation or other evaluation metrics. The choice of which classifier to use ultimately depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem, and the performance of each classifier on the task."
