If the research question and hypothesis specify a direction, a one-tailed test is appropriate.

This error occurs when a researcher concludes that there is a significant effect or difference between two groups when in reality there is no such effect or difference.

They conduct a study with a sample of patients and find a statistically significant improvement in symptoms. However, in reality, the drug has no effect on the symptoms of the disease, and the observed difference is due to chance. The researcher commits a Type 1 error by rejecting the null hypothesis that the drug has no effect when it is actually true.\n",

    "## A Type 2 error is the acceptance of a null hypothesis when it is actually false. This error occurs when a researcher fails to detect a significant effect or difference between two groups when in reality there is such an effect or difference. Type 2 errors are also called false negatives and have a significance level denoted by beta.\n",
    "### Example: A researcher wants to determine whether a new educational program improves the academic performance of students. They conduct a study with a sample of students and find no statistically significant difference in performance between the group that received the educational program and the control group. However, in reality, the program does improve academic performance, but the observed difference is not statistically significant due to a small sample size or other factors. The researcher commits a Type 2 error by accepting the null hypothesis that the program has no effect when it is actually false.\n",

    "## Both Type 1 and Type 2 errors are possible in any hypothesis testing scenario, and researchers need to balance the risks of each type of error when designing their studies and interpreting their results. Reducing the risk of one type of error often increases the risk of the other, so it is important to carefully consider the consequences of each type of error in the specific context of the research question."

This means that even though Bag A has fewer blue marbles, there is still a relatively high probability that we chose it if we drew a blue marble, because Bag B has a much higher proportion of blue marbles overall."

    "### The p-value is much smaller than our significance level of 0.05, which means that the probability of observing a t-value as extreme as ours (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis were true is very small. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean reaction time for the population of individuals taking the caffeine is significantly different from zero at a 90% confidence level. In other words, we can be confident that the caffeine is effective on reaction time."
