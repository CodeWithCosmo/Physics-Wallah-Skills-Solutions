However, if the same measure were used for income, it would be misleading since income has a true zero point.\n",

Descriptive statistics are used to describe the data in a way that is easily understood, using measures of central tendency, such as mean, median, and mode, as well as measures of dispersion, such as range and standard deviation. For example, if a researcher is interested in describing the height of a population, they may calculate the mean and standard deviation of the height data.\n",

Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses, estimate parameters, and make predictions about a population based on a sample of data. For example, if a researcher wants to test whether a new drug is effective in reducing blood pressure, they may conduct a randomized controlled trial on a sample of patients and use inferential statistics to determine whether the results of the study can be generalized to the larger population."

The most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode, while the most common measures of variability are the range, standard deviation, and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.Mean: The mean is the most common measure of central tendency, and it is calculated by adding up all of the values in a data set and dividing by the total number of values. The mean represents the average value of the data set, and it is a useful measure when the data is normally distributed and there are no extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Median: The median is the middle value in a data set when the values are arranged in order. The median is a useful measure of central tendency when the data set has extreme values or is skewed, as it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. The mode is useful when identifying the most common value or category in a data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.Range: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a data set. The range is a simple measure of variability, but it can be sensitive to outliers and may not provide a comprehensive picture of the spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.Standard deviation: The standard deviation is a measure of the spread or variability of a data set, and it is calculated by finding the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is a useful measure when the data is normally distributed, as it describes how much the data varies from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.Variance: The variance is a measure of how much the data is spread out from the mean, and it is calculated by finding the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. Variance is a useful measure of variability, but it is less commonly used than the standard deviation."
