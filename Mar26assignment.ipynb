At each iteration, the algorithm calculates the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter, which indicates the direction in which the cost function is decreasing the fastest. The algorithm then updates the values of the parameters by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient, with a step size determined by a learning rate hyperparameter.\n",

This can lead to unstable estimates of the regression coefficients, and can make it difficult to interpret the effects of the individual independent variables on the dependent variable.\n",

Correlation coefficients close to +1 or -1 indicate high correlation between the variables, while coefficients close to 0 indicate low correlation. Another way to detect multicollinearity is to calculate the variance inflation factor (VIF) for each independent variable. The VIF measures how much the variance of the estimated regression coefficient for each variable is increased due to the presence of other independent variables in the model. A VIF value greater than 10 indicates a problem with multicollinearity.\n",

This can help to reduce the instability of the estimates and improve the interpretability of the coefficients.
