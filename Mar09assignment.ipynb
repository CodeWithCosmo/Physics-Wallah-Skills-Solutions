    "# Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "### The Central Limit Theorem makes several assumptions about the population distribution from which the samples are drawn. These assumptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.Independence: Each observation in the sample is independent of all other observations. This means that the value of one observation does not affect the value of any other observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.Sample size: The sample size should be large enough. While there is no exact number for how large the sample size should be, a general rule of thumb is that the sample size should be at least 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.Random sampling: The sample should be drawn randomly from the population. This means that each observation in the population should have an equal chance of being selected for the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.Finite variance: The population from which the sample is drawn should have a finite variance. This means that the variance of the population distribution should not be infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "### These assumptions are important because violating any of them can lead to inaccurate results. For example, if the observations in the sample are not independent, the Central Limit Theorem may not apply. Similarly, if the sample size is too small or the sample is not drawn randomly, the sample mean may not be a good estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It is worth noting that while the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem are important, in practice the theorem tends to be quite robust to violations of these assumptions. This means that even if the assumptions are not perfectly met, the Central Limit Theorem may still be applicable, especially if the sample size is large enough."
